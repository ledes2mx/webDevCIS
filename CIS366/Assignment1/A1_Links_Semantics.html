        <h2>Problems with disablilities in web pages</h2>
        <p>
            There are only a few real issues I can conceive of,
            those being color blindness, epilepsy, and not being able
            to make the words bigger or smaller as necessary. I think
            these are the only issues web developers can help with. Other
            issues like operating a mouse are limited to those who know how to
            overcome such issues. The only thng I could see that web devs could
            do is make a site easier to navigate, but they could also use alternate
            descriptions of images

        <h2>Why use proper semantic elements appropriately?</h2>
        <p>
            Appropriate use of semantic elements is important because it
            helps with the organization and design of web pages that could be
            used in the industry. not only does it hekp with organization, it 
            helps a great deal when you are looking to keep things uniform
            throughout an entire webpage. Things such as headings, links, footers,
            ect. would not only potentially look ununiform, it would also be a pain
            for the web designer to customize every one of these elements to appear
            the same. They could also be used incase someone is completely blind in 
            a way that helps them know what an image is supposed to be instead of them
            not knowing that there is an image in the first place. You can also use them
            for showing code written in a way you are supposed to with proper coding conventions.<br>
