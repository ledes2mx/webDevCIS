                    Forced action is defined as a situation in which the user is required to do something to access functionalities of some website or some application or program.
                    These can range from agreeing to "Terms and Conditions" that are used in applications such as Apple Media Services to blocking some users of applications or games
                    because they have not fulfilled some condition to continue. When Apple uses this technique, they sometimes tend to block applications from downloading or updating,
                    meaning that the user would have to agree to something that is most likely not visible or clear to the user such as information sharing just to continue to use applications.
                    When video games use this technique, they put some playable missions behind a level barrier, meaning that the player would have to play something that they would
                    otherwise not want to play to access the area or mission that they do want to play.

                    Obstruction by definition is impeding the user from completing a task, making the user's experience to complete a task much more difficult than the user expects it
                    to be. These sorts of techniques seem to be much more popular with sites and companies that require a subscription as well as sites that want to push some sort of
                    notification on people who visit their website, such as Zynga, Amazon, and the New York Times. There are various techniques that these companies can use, such as
                    hiding the link to unsubscribe to the user's subscription by making the text's color the same color as the background of the site, or even trying to confuse the user
                    by switching what would be the confirm to unsubscribe button with a similar looking button, but it stops the user from unsubscribing. They can also make the unsubscribe
                    link more lowkey by putting the link under the large cancel button in small text.

        <h3>1. Forced Action</h3>
        <img class="left-float" src="Images/FA1.png" height="150">
        <p>
            Forced action is defined as a situation in which the user is required to do something to access functionalities of some website or some application or program.
            These can range from agreeing to "Terms and Conditions" that are used in applications such as Apple Media Services to blocking some users of applications or games

        <p>
            It appears that these sorts of situations can arise at any point, not just on the web. As discussed before, these techniques are used so that agreements are made that
            likely will not be noticed by any users, therefore allowing these companies to hide things such as information sharing or information sales while technically giving
            those usersâ€™ knowledge of them doing these things by hiding them in long user agreements that users will likely not read.

        <h3>2. Obstruction</h3>
        <p>
            Obstruction by definition is impeding the user from completing a task, making the user's experience to complete a task much more difficult than the user expects it
            to be. These sorts of techniques seem to be much more popular with sites and companies that require a subscription as well as sites that want to push some sort of
            notification on people who visit their website, such as Zynga, Amazon, and the New York Times. There are various techniques that these companies can use, such as
            hiding the link to unsubscribe to the user's subscription by making the text's color the same color as the background of the site, or even trying to confuse the user
            by switching what would be the confirm to unsubscribe button with a similar looking button, but it stops the user from unsubscribing. They can also make the unsubscribe
            link more lowkey by putting the link under the large cancel button in small text.

        <img class="left-float" src="Images/Obstruct1.png" height="200">
        <p>
            There are, of course, other methods of obstructing the user from doing something that they intend to do. Often times, we see that distractions such as pop-ups for advertisements
            appear for things we would likely want due to browsing history, or even pop-ups that would do something completely different, such as leading the user to another page with
            some sort of offer or something that would entice the user to direct them somewhere else.
